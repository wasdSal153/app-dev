# My Favorite TV Series

Since I was a kid, I have been watching shows on my parents' CRT TV. Through that TV, I enjoyed episodes of TV series like [Smallville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallville), [24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)), and [Scrubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubs_(TV_series)). By watching those shows, I developed a liking towards watching TV series and out of all the series that I have watched, there is one TV series that I enjoyed watching the most. The name of my favorite TV series is called [*The Boys*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)). It is a TV series about people with superpowers and how they belong in a corporate-driven society.
